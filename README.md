# Liha - Open source intiutive second brain studio. 

Liha is a project which comes out my own need to have a second brain software which is local-first, open-source and doesn't cost me a fortune to have AI nicely integrated into it.
It is a tool to help you organize your thoughts, notes, and ideas in a structured way. It is designed to be simple, easy to use, and flexible.

It is majorily inspired by Obsidian, Capacities and Notion.

## Features
- **Markdown**: Write in markdown and get a live preview of your notes.
- **Local First**: Your data is stored locally on your device.
- **Grid Notes**: Create notes in a grid view - drag and resize the notes.
- **Object Types**: Create different types of objects like notes, tasks, events, etc.

### Images of current state of the project

### Todo for first release:

## Usage
Make sure you have the dependencies installed for the golang backend and the frontend - which uses pnpm.

Run `wails dev` to start the application in development mode.

## Contributing
NOTE: The project is in early stages of development. There is a lot of work to be done and will find a lot of code to be messy - I am working towards the major features and will refactor the codebase once the major features are implemented.

Feel free to explore around and make a PR if you find something interesting to add or fix.
